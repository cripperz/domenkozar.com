title: "Ideas for a week project"

On 9th of August I return from vacations and I decided to research on some new area in the week
after. Currently, there are two ideas, both easy-to-implement: 

**1. Ping my host every 5 minutes and send me email if down**

I know there are many websites which touch this topic but; Most of them are limited and need
subscription. I want something basic, to do just what I want. 

WHY:

- learn basic Google App Engine development 

- GAE provides reliable hosting with strong uptimes 

**2. List of websites mapped to tagged keywords**

I have not found a simple, yet populated website that would provide list of websites based on some
tag/keyword. Example: search for a "subtitle" tag and it would yield all websites where you can
download subtitles for movies. 

WHY:

- first time get known with MongoDB and it's usage

- learn how to estimate project timeline management with Pylons 

What's your opinion? Out in the Web World, is there something exactly what I'm trying to do?
