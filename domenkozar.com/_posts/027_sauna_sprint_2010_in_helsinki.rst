At last, so called `Sauna Sprint 2010 <http://plone.org/events/community/sauna-sprint-2010/>`_ has
been announced. First of all, cheers to `Nejc <http://twitter.com/nzupan>`_ and Joni for all the
work done. 

What is the story behind the Sauna Sprint? At the end of 2009, EESTEC IT team had a sprint at
Chairpersons meet in `Skopje <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skopje>`_ (we had a great time, big
thanks to organizers!). We created from scratch the new `eestec.net <http://eestec.net/>`_ portal
(fully `open-sourced <http://plone.org/products/eestec.base>`_ and `documented
<http://docs.eestec.net/>`_). 

So, the idea came to make a sauna sprint, hosted by Joni in Helsinki, that would eventually make
Plone itself a tiny bit better world by our small team. Some of our experienced Plone developers
will be introducing newcomers to Plone CMS. More details about the whole week can be found at
`plone.org <http://plone.org/events/community/sauna-sprint-2010/>`_. 

Leaning to the darker side of the story, I'm still a student and returning airplane ticket for
Ljubljana <-> Helsinki is about **400$** **300$** at the moment. As I currently don't see an option
to collect the money in given time, I have opened `chipin account
<http://ielectric.chipin.com/airplane-returning-ticket-for-plone-sauna-sprint>`_ for anyone willing
to give me a hand. `Nevertheless <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.amberjack.core/>`_, `I
