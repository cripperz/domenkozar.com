It has been a long time since last blog post. Not that I have nothing to say, but a lot has happend in last half a year and I promised
myself I would switch to new blogging platform before using it again.

Welcome `blogofile <www.blogofile.com>`_. Since `Zine <http://zine.pocoo.org/>`_ is `history <http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2010/1/6/status-update-2010/>`_, I figured out static website/blog is what I should do in the first place. Now, my whole blog (including all posts) is available at `github.com <https://github.com/iElectric/domenkozar.com>`_. Instead of reporting issues with blog in comments, you can create pull request for me to review and push to production.

I was `accepted <https://twitter.com/#!/iElectric/status/62596089399877632>`_ for `Google Summer of Code 2011 <http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2011>`_ again, this time working on **TinyMCE integration improvements for Plone CMS**. Weekly reports coming up!
