Greetings, following is the update for `Substance D <http://substanced.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ project.
Substance D is an application server built using the Pyramid web framework. It can be used as a base to build
a general-purpose web application like a blog, a shopping cart application, a scheduling application, or any
other web app that requires both an administration and a retail interface. Substance D owes much of its spirit
to the Zope application server.  Quick links to project info:

Last three weeks were pretty intense:

- EuroPython2013 conference. I had a blast with the people from Python community.
  I talked about `Tools for successful project development <https://ep2013.europython.eu/conference/talks/tools-for-successful-project-development>`_,
  had a `Plone CMS development training <https://ep2013.europython.eu/conference/talks/getting-started-with-plone-cms-development>`_ and hosted an open
  space about `NixOS declarative configuration Linux distribution <https://ep2013.europython.eu/conference/talks/nixos-operating-system-declarative-configuration-distribution>`_.
  For the last two days of conference, I sprinted with `Balázs Reé <https://twitter.com/reebalazs>`_ on Substance D 

- Submitted `pull request <https://github.com/Pylons/substanced/pull/85>`_ where we completely change how we handle JavaScript in Substance D

- Updated some of documentation

- Started working on https://github.com/Pylons/substanced/issues/71

Next week:

- Finish https://github.com/Pylons/substanced/issues/71

- Start thinking about how to implement multilingual support for Substance D
