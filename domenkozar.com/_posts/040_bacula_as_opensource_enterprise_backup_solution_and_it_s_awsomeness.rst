draft: true

I've been writing this post since ever. It's meant to be a quick summary why you should replace your
homegrown or paid backup solution with Bacula. - SSL/TLS - encryption - director, file daemon,
storage daemon - tapes support - backup/restore as "transaction" (no failover) - crossplatform -
server -> client (vpn) - modularity - has it's own Rescue CD - community (freenode #bacula) -
administration: bconsole, xconsole, BAT, web bacula More on features:

replace your old backup method, run both solution for at least a month.
