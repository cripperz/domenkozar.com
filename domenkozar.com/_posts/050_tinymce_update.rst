Products.TinyMCE 1.3 is not ready to be released, but we are advancing:

- `PLIP <https://dev.plone.org/ticket/12844>`_ was submitted by Tom Gross (kudos!) to include Products.TinyMCE 1.3 into Plone 4.3 release. 

- Upcoming Friday (18th of May), Plone tuneup will be focused on fixing TinyMCE bugs and cleaning up the bug tracker. I will attend tuneup and will focus on answering questions regarding Products.TinyMCE. Join #plone-tuneup on irc.freenode.net to participate!

- Second week of July 2012, another awesome Plone sprint will happen. This year `we are traveling to Belgium to do some proper beer driven development <http://www.coactivate.org/projects/belgian-beer-sprint/project-home>`_. My focus will be Products.TinyMCE and GSOC2012 Pylons Organization work on `Substance D <https://github.com/Pylons/substanced>`_.
 
Cheers, Domen
