I'm very happy first stage of my Gentoo mirror project is done. 

More information about server, how to use it with Gentoo and statitics can be read `here
<http://gentoo.fubar.si/>`_ 

Server is an old box of my girlfriend (thanks!). The box used to have issues with rebooting during
ubuntu gnome session, I hope it was graphic's card fault (no graphic desktop is running now). 

Consider this beta testing period, spread the world of Slovenian Gentoo mirror! Link is **50/50mbit
FTTH**. Current location of server is temporary, until I find free provider to sponzor full 100mbit
link. Leave any questions at domen[AT]dev.si
